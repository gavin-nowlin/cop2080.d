# Scientific Python Interactive Data Acoustic Modeling

This python project finds the average RT60 time for the sound of a hand clap. The ideal difference for speech intelligibility is 0.5 seconds, any difference value over 0.5 seconds means vocal intelligibility is reduced in the location the audio was recorded in.

After all the requirements have been installed, run the controller.py file to use the program. Navigate through each graph by closing the previous one. Pressing the extra data button will show you a graph with more visual information about the sound.
